## Lore
Welcome space traveller! If you are reading this, you have been chosen for a mission to save the Earth from space debris!

200 years ago, there was a man named Elon Musk who launched a constellation of Space Junk. One day there was a spacequake and the space junk exploded,
and now we have crazy shapes between us and the moon!

At the time of receiving this mission, you should already be at designated Moon Base, sponsored by the Pepsi Corporation. 

There should also be a rocket ship waiting for you. It only has enough fuel to get you to Earth,
but luckily we installed an autopilot for you. The problem is, the autopilot doesn't know where
the junk is, so we added 3 routes for it to go to. You can change the route using the left and right keys.

Unfortunately, you can't go back. But, just like life, you look forward, and press up key to accelerate towards Earth to see if your family survives.

If you are a coward, you slow down with down key. But you can never stop. There is no stop. Never.

We want you to pick up materials that humans on Earth and outer territories need: spheres, stars, icosehedrons, and donuts.

The sphere is gelatinous fuel, that conviently doesn't work on your futuristic rocket because it is powered by coal (that's why there is fire in the exhaust)
The star is fragments of planets long lost in our solar system due to space fracking. That's how we got the spheres.
The icosehedrons are biblically-accurate mathmatics that need to be collected in order to pass the Linear 2 exam. Generations have failed ever since we lost them.
The donut is a type of food made from leavened fried dough.
It is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors.
Doughnut is the traditional spelling, while donut is the simplified version; the terms are often used interchangeably.

However, the evil Elon Musk starlink has thrown space junk everywhere and it is really annoying. We saved some money on your hull space
so we don't want you picking up this stuff, it will make you drop the good resources.

Oh yeah you are getting paid the galactic minimum wage of 1.2 Bitcoins per year, but if you are able to accrue more than 5 score, we will give you a bonus.

## Instructions
Please extract the zip file to replace the `src/` folder. We have additional JS files, textures, sounds, and new skyboxes that all need to live in the same directory as `hw6.js`.

## Bonus(es)
Planets spin around themselves (1 point)
Add more scenery (1 point).
Game is time-dependent instead of framerate dependent (2 points)
Bad stars that decrease your score instead of increasing it (3 points)
The spaceship goes slower/faster with the ArrowUp/ArrowDown keys (3 points)

Extras (for more bonus points, please <3):
We added a satellite to Earth.
We added other planets, 
Added a new skybox
Procedurally generated stars.
Space junk is randomly generated
Star types have different material properties.
Multiple types of collectives with different models and point values.
All the planets orbit around each other
Planets have bump maps
Earth has a bump + specular map.
The dark side of the Earth has night lights.
Legend for score values
Live score counter w/ gradient font
Custom document title.
Fire animation on the rocket, and light out the back.
Freeroam orbit mode if you get more than 5 score to view the solar system.
Custom sun.
