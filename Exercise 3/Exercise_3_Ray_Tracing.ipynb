    "The concept of ray tracing: a technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of visual realism, usually higher than that of typical scanline rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost.\n",

    "The objective of this exercise is to implement a ray casting/tracing engine. A ray tracer shoots rays from the observerâ€™s eye through a screen and into a scene of objects. It calculates the rayâ€™s\n",
    "intersection with the objects, finds the nearest intersection and calculates the color of the surface according to its material and lighting conditions. _(This is the way you should think about it â€“\n",

    "- There is a difference between how you treat every 3D Objects. You can differentiate of which class is each object with *isinstance()*\n",
    "- With barycentric coordinates test, you may want to use some epsilon as we are working with float values.\n",
    "- Using the exact intersection point may lead to bugs. After finding an intersection, choose a close point that is above the intersection point (Think - How can I shift a point \"above\" the surface? what is the direction?)"
